Refloat is an open-source project dedicated to refining the VESC experience for Onewheels, a.k.a. self-balancing skateboards. Its goals are:
- Provide a smooth, intuitive and glitch-free ride.
- An open, clean and hackable codebase that’s easy for anyone to explore, review and experiment with.
- A commitment to keep evolving and pushing the boundaries of what open-source Onewheels can do.
