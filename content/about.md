Hello, welcome to my website. I'm an enthusiast Onewheel rider and also an all-around DIY guy. I mod most things I own and a Onewheel is basically a modder's dream. This website is here to document and share my Onewheel work.

Designing 3D models isn't cheap, and I give them away for free. If you printed my models and like them, please consider donating.
