# Hello! I'm Luke.

I'm a Onewheel rider and developer passionate about pushing the limits of what self-balancing boards can do.

I spend much of my time developing [Refloat](/refloat/), a VESC Onewheel package. Crafted with love over countless hours, the project aims to deliver a smoother, safer, and more intuitive riding experience for everyone in the community.

## Support the Mission
Developing and testing takes a significant amount of time and hardware. If Refloat has improved your ride, please consider [supporting the project](/donate/).

Your contributions directly help funding the development of better software for the entire community.
